This error indicates that Git is in the middle of a rebase operation that needs to be completed or aborted. Let me help you resolve this.

You have a few options to resolve this Git rebase state:

Option 1: Abort the rebase (recommended if you want to cancel)
git rebase --abort
This will cancel the rebase and return your repository to the state it was in before the rebase started.

Option 2: Continue the rebase (if you want to complete it)
If you've resolved any conflicts and want to continue:

git rebase --continue
Option 3: Skip the current commit (if there are issues with a specific commit)
git rebase --skip
Check the current status first
To see what's happening with your Git repository:

git status
This will show you if there are any conflicts that need to be resolved before you can continue or abort the rebase.

Recommendation: If you're unsure about the rebase or didn't intentionally start one, use git rebase --abort to safely return to your previous state. Then you can use the Git pane in Replit for future Git operations, which provides a more user-friendly interface.

I can see you're in the middle of a Git rebase with conflicts that need to be resolved. Looking at the status output, there are conflicts in the files and a deleted README.md file. Let me help you resolve this.

The main issues are:

README.md was deleted by the incoming changes
package.json and src/App.tsx have modifications that need to be staged
Let's resolve these conflicts step by step:

git add src/App.tsx
git add package.json
git rm README.md
git rebase --continue
This will:

Stage the modified src/App.tsx and package.json files
Accept the deletion of README.md
Continue the rebase process
If you encounter any issues or need to abort the rebase instead, you can run git rebase --abort to return to the previous state.

The Git lock file issue is preventing any Git operations. Let's fix this first and then help you commit to a new repository.

First, let's remove the lock file:

rm -f .git/index.lock
Now let's abort the current rebase to get back to a clean state:

git rebase --abort
Now, to commit to a new repository, you'll need to:

Create a new repository on GitHub (or use the Git pane in Replit)
Change your remote URL to point to the new repository
Let's check your current remote:

git remote -v
Once you have your new repository URL, you can change the remote with:

git remote set-url origin YOUR_NEW_REPO_URL
Then stage and commit your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit to new repository"
git push -u origin main
Alternatively, you can use the Git pane in Replit to create a new repository directly by going to the Git settings (gear icon) and creating a new repository on GitHub.

the new git repo is: https://github.com/lisainnovates/mewd-tracker

Perfect! I can see you want to update your Git remote to point to the new repository https://github.com/lisainnovates/mewd-tracker. Let's update the remote URL and push your changes to the new repository.

First, let's update the remote URL:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/lisainnovates/mewd-tracker
Let's verify the remote has been updated:

git remote -v
Now let's stage all your current changes:

git add .
Commit the changes:

git commit -m "Initial commit to mewd-tracker repository"
Push to the new repository:

git push -u origin main
I also notice that your package.json still references the old repository URLs. Let me update those to match your new repository:

package.json
Update repository URLs to new repo, Update repository and bugs URLs
what to do now

I can see you're dealing with Git lock file issues that are preventing your operations from completing. Let's resolve this step by step.

The issue is that there are multiple Git lock files preventing operations. Let's clean these up:

find .git -name "*.lock" -type f -delete
Now let's check your Git status to see the current state:

git status
Since you want to commit to the new repository https://github.com/lisainnovates/mewd-tracker, let's update the remote URL properly:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/lisainnovates/mewd-tracker.git
Let's verify the remote is updated:

git remote -v
Now let's stage all your changes and commit to the new repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit to mewd-tracker repository"
git push -u origin main
This should resolve the Git lock issues and successfully push your code to the new mewd-tracker repository. The lock files were preventing Git from performing any operations, so removing them should allow everything to work properly.

this isn't working...

I can see you're dealing with a Git rebase conflict that's preventing you from committing to your new repository. Let's resolve this step by step.

First, let's abort the current rebase to get back to a clean state:

git rebase --abort
Now let's check what branch you're on and clean up any remaining lock files:

git branch
find .git -name "*.lock" -type f -delete
Let's switch to the main branch and check the status:

git checkout main
git status
Now let's update the remote URL to point to your new repository:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/lisainnovates/mewd-tracker.git
Let's add all your current changes and commit them:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit to mewd-tracker repository"
Finally, push to your new repository:

git push -u origin main
This should resolve the Git conflicts and successfully push your mood tracker app to the new mewd-tracker repository. The rebase was causing conflicts because it was trying to apply commits in a specific order, but aborting it will get you back to a clean state where you can commit normally.

i deleted the old repo

Great! Since you deleted the old repository, let's complete the setup for your new mewd-tracker repository. The rebase is now gone, so we can proceed cleanly.

Let's check the current Git status and then commit everything to your new repository:

git status
git remote -v
Now let's add all your files and commit them to the new repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Pokémon mood tracker app"
git push -u origin main
This should successfully push your mood tracker app to the new mewd-tracker repository without any rebase conflicts since the old repository is gone.

Apply all:
Run shell command:
git status
Run shell command:
git remote -v
Run shell command:
git add .
Run shell command:
git commit -m "Initial commit - Pokémon mood tracker app"
Run shell command:
git push -u origin main
Nothing to commit
